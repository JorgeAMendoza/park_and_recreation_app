# Park and Recreation Mobile Application
Capstone project that has been in production since Fall 2019. The course taught us how to do research for creating an application. The course taught students how to plan the development of an applicaiton, research what was needed for a project of this scale, how to present our ideas, and eventually create an actual working product. 
The PDF in the repository shows all of our work this past year. 

# The Idea for the mobile Application
As someone who works at a recreation center I realized that our services should be reaching more people in the community. The City of Dallas has a website that does give information about recreation centers but I did not find it very user friendly. So I came up with the simple idea of a mobile application that gives up to date information about City of Dallas recreation centers while also making it easy for the employees to add,delete, and edit that information. I believed that this would make it easier for the community to get up to date information on recreation centers since almost everybody has a smartphone now and are usually inclinded to check their applications rather than websites. 

# Contributions
This a group project that involved 4 other students. My contributions included the following: the basic idea for the application, research into similar applications, research into various software engineering processes , the initial and final sketches for the user interface, and writing most of the code.
